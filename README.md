# HidDriver 360
Experimental on-console HID driver focussing on providing third party controller support to the xbox 360 without USB patches or dongles.

## What works
- Supports both 17559 retail and 17489 devkit dashboards
- Reading controller input via USB
- Up to 4 concurrent controllers, in combination with original xbox 360 controllers or without them
- Controllers are registered inside xam and therefore fully recognized in the entire xbox 360 user interface, ring of light will update accordingly, no original controllers are needed etc
- The controller works in all tested games

## Current limitations
- no rumble support

## Supported controllers
- DualShock 4 (PS4 controller)
- DualShock 4 Wireless Adapter (CUH-ZWA1E)
- DualSense (PS5 controller)
- DualSense Edge
- Keyboard (99% should work as most send the same HID, feel free to report by making an issue if a specific model doesn't work)
  > **Xbox Home** - TAB  
  > **Select** - Backspace  
  > **Start** - Enter  
  > **Left Analog** - WASD  
  > **Right Analog** - IJKL  
  > **ABXY** - ZXCV  
  > **D-PAD** - Arrows  
  > **L1/R1** - Q/E  
  > **L2/R2** - Left SHIFT/Left CTRL  
  > **L3/R3** - Left ALT/Right ALT  
- more to come, as its quite easy to extend

## How to build
1. Acquire the official Xbox 360 SDK using black magic
2. Install visual studio 2010 ultimate and visual studio 2019
3. Install the sdk using the "FULL" preset
4. Open the solution in visual studio 2019 and build
